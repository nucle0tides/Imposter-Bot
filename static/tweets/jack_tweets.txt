Thank you all for your passion and trust. We will continue to work to earn it, and we will continue to listen, and talk!
Twitter can help make connections in real-time based on dynamic interests and topics, rather than a static social/friend graph. We get it.
I *love* real-time. We love the live stream. It's us. And we're going to continue to refine it to make Twitter feel more, not less, live!
Look at "while you were away" at the top of your TL. Tweets you missed from people you follow. Pull to refresh to go back to real-time.
Twitter is live. Twitter is real-time. Twitter is about who &amp; what you follow. And Twitter is here to stay! By becoming more Twitter-y.
Hello Twitter! Regarding #RIPTwitter: I want you all to know we're always listening. We never planned to reorder timelines next week.

@couch Really? Wow, didn't know that.
I'm excited for 2016! It's going to be a great year. #happynewyear to all of you! What's good?
Was an amazing feeling, to see the world light up like that in real time. Felt very small.
I was sick that NYE, so I watched the program go around the world right from my apt, people tweeting back what was good!
On NYE one year I built a small feature called the New Years nudge. It would ask "what's happening?" 5 minutes before midnight in your area.
(Biz would usually respond with something about one of the animals living at his house, dog, cat, turtle, etc.)
You could send "nudge biz" via text and he'd get a "jack wants to know what you're doing!" text
Way back in the day Twitter had a feature called "nudge". Anyone remember it?

@DrPizza both. More power and utility for people who do use it. And easier to understand for those that don't!
@astroehlein @twitter we will!
That's all for now. We'll have a bit more to say on the Twitter investor call today at 5:30a Pacific (see @twitterIR for all the details). ‚úå
Our work forward is to make Twitter easy to understand by anyone in the world, and give more utility to the people who love to use it daily!
We're working hard at Twitter to focus our roadmap on a few things we can make really great. And we're strengthening our team along the way.
Both companies have strong businesses and are well positioned to grow their impact in the world. I will do whatever it takes to ensure that.
Twitter is the most powerful communications tool of our time. It shows everything the world is saying rn‚Ä¶10-15 minutes before anything else.
Twitter stands for freedom of expression. We stand for speaking truth to power. And we stand for empowering dialogue.
Square is the most powerful set of tools to start, run &amp; grow a business. Download Square, start selling. Download Square, get cash to grow.
Square stands for economic empowerment. We stand for financial systems that serve instead of rule. We stand for leveling the playing field.
A few things about each company, and their impact in the world. What we stand for gives us purpose, and that purpose dictates our job ahead.
My focus is to build teams that move fast, and learn faster. In the past 3 months we have increased our speed and urgency at both companies.
I've been CEO of both companies for over 3 months now. I have the smartest, strongest, and most determined leaders in the world on my teams.
We are naming @adambain COO of Twitter, we're working to change the composition of our Board, and I will serve as CEO of Twitter and Square!

9/And an extra-special thanks to the one who first broke the news that http://t.co/djh1XZJUKJ was a thing: @om! We love you Om! üåæ
8/THANK YOU for keeping the world (and us!) honest and using Twitter to do your work. We wouldn't be here without you.
7/Journalists make Twitter better by providing context, research, and a balanced perspective drawn from what the people experience.
6/Twitter makes journalism better by providing direct access to the people and events as they happen.
5/Journalists were a big part of why we grew so quickly and still a big reason why people use Twitter: news. It's a natural fit.
4/After the tech early-adopters, journalists were  next to take to Twitter. They used it as a source, to break news, and to link their work.
3/Journalists play a critical role in our society: keep the world honest and balanced. They are true servants of the people.
2/So many around the world have helped make Twitter what it is, but there's one group I'd like to thank today: journalists.
üê§‚ö°Ô∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è 1/Twitter turns 9 years old today. 9 years! Birthdays are always a good time to express some gratitude.
