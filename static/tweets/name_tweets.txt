Thank you @theprp for giving me reason to appreciate what I and our friends do. Working, strong, level headed artists. Fuck you, Danny.
@thedannyworsnop You're not special, you will not be remembered. Only reason you gain this attention is for being a narrow, ignorant child.
So to @thedannyworsnop. Shut your mouth before someone with an OUNCE of artistic integrity shuts it for you. Stop crying about your "issues"
I'm simply frustrated because people like him destroy everything we and those LIKE us fight for in this scene. Those bands deserve better.
Want a fucking hashtag? #FuckDannyWorsnop or #FuckAskingAlexandria. Get THAT shit trending. Call out this infantile, poser bitch of a singer
The fact people even ENCOURAGE you by buying your records and going to your shows is MIND BLOWING. You single-handedly kill integrity.
Danzig, Axl Rose, Kanye West, etc. You are NOT them, you're a spoon fed, english little prick who hasn't paid his dues NOR earned his keep.
