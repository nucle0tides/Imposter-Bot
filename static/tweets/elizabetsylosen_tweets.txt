Tune in at noon to see if the season bot actually auto-posts a random, unused tweet when it needs to.
I spent a long time creating possible "5th seasons" with the help of T&amp;G. They aren't all golden, but I like to think we did okay.
RT @FifthSeasonofCR: The fifth season of Cedar Rapids is unlimited breadsticks.

(Also DM @FifthSeasonofCR any suggestions for what the fifth season may be.)

@herro_its_jon hmmm, that's true. Didn't think of that.
Why am I trying to have elaborate conversations on twitter? What am I doing? This is a mess.
@herro_its_jon I guess it depends on if the person is more afraid of "being brainwashed into sin" or "violence"
@herro_its_jon along with gays having the potential to be born to good Christian straight white parents?
@herro_its_jon see and I think I'd argue that blacks are more hated because they have the whole "dangerous and stupid" stereotype.
@herro_its_jon I think that would be my guess too... they just seem the most bible-belt-y
On a similar note, does the deep south hate homosexuals or black people more? Discuss.
@purple_moron I think it's legal, but there's currently a hold on marriages??? Government is confusing.
@herro_its_jon A+ 100%
(For reference) http://t.co/SVCFufpLmH
@purple_moron it's already legal there! There are some surprising states already that have passed it.

@herro_its_jon exactly. I only have 140 characters, cut me some slack!
@herro_its_jon in the same way that femininity=good mothers so men lose a lot of custody cases. Is that blaming all women?
@herro_its_jon men themselves didn't do anything. centuries of men holding most power have made the gender roles that way.
@herro_its_jon no? I'm not attacking men at all. I've been saying this whole time, it's unrealistic gender roles, not "ALL MEN ARE KILLERS"
@herro_its_jon I'm not blaming men and masculinity by any means, but these high standards of MEN GOTTA BE THE BEST ALPHA MALE
@herro_its_jon this isn't "what it means to be a man" it's letting gender roles take over and letting your need for strength&amp;power overrule
@herro_its_jon in what way?

But at least both of my finals are on Monday HAHAHAHAHAHAH
Realizing that I'll be living in my house again in literally less than 30 days is just about the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.

You think CprE guys are the worst, but you obviously haven't met AerE guys. (You're obnoxious, go away)
Probably because Tom was like "I'm going to bed" and he hasn't gone to sleep at a reasonable hour in weeks. Clearly today was hard for him.
I was just thinking to myself "wow its like 2 am I should get some sleep" but then I looked at the clock and it was barely 10:30.
*eats a bowl of ice cream* "wow that wasn't really all that satisfying." *promptly scoops another bowl*
@Kimlosen I don't think he has the right kind of bunnies. It's great to feel lonely again though!
@Kimlosen a bunny? I'd love that!
LOOK if I'm not going to get the bunny could someone AT LEAST bring me a peanut butter and honey sandwich?
Can't believe I'm still sitting here alone without this bunny. http://t.co/BgUGdXvnLV

Ah, to live a life glorifying pet ownership because you're lonely and can't own a pet yourself. #sos
@PearShapedNerd it's perfect, now all I need is a ride to the pet store.
@nucle0tides what...You're not being an ass. Someone needs to say it. I'm obviously exaggerating the joy and wonder that a bunny would bring
@nucle0tides I know, you've told me this:/ I have a huge scratch on my hand from the bunny yesterday.
@nucle0tides I know but so do I.
This is embarrassing. I'm holding back tears because I can't have a bunny. 
WHAT'S HAPPENING
@PearShapedNerd you can name it if it means I can have a bunny.
Good news, dad. The bunny can be restricted to one area and allergic reactions can be minimized. Please let me have a bunny.
Granted there's only one month left of school, the perfect time to rebel!
Don't deny me this happiness. http://t.co/BLyyfajD5b

I desperately need a back rub. I'm pretty sure it's just one big knot.
@Snooooooook Oh calm down.
@nucle0tides fill me innnnnn
Today's productivity level was far lower than I had hoped or expected. 
The best part was when Thomas made me ramen.
@Snooooooook PREACH IT
@nucle0tides it's quiet and cute and I'm sorry I tweeted about it :O
Sometimes gabby snores. #just2340things
When you try to just shuffle Los Campesinos! on Spotify, but the album of a Mexican folk band is thrown in the mix too.
@nucle0tides my mind is blooooown.
Too many CprE and SoftE majors in this room. I did not sign up for this.
IT DOES. That's so cute.
Aw omg I think gabby's phone buzzes every time I tweet something.
I hope to wear enough dark red lipstick that my lips will be permanently stained the color of BLOOD. 
THE BLOOD OF THE PATRIARCHY.
If you aren't spending your Friday curled up under a blanket listening to sad Bon Iver songs, then wow what are you even doing.

A single tear for the fact that @TheNewPornos  haven't released an album since 2010.
On that note, shout out to my mom, grandma, &amp; aunt for all having really great eyebrows. I can only hope to live up to the Jorgensen women.
I don't understand people who think it's word to compliment someone's eyebrows. THEY ARE A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF YOUR FACE.
@khaleesi_ebooks as long as they are dark and powerful, all else is fine.
I AM THE CARB QUEEN
Trying to think of something clever to say about gabby and I isolating ourselves more by living in a double next year, but it is what it is.
RT @Snooooooook: One could easily confuse Gabby and Betsy's room for a Bath and Body Works. #Aroma
Brendan dresses well&gt; Corbin dresses well.  Brendan looks like Benedict Cumberbatch&gt; Corbin loves him. Brendan and Corbin should date. QED
February 17th, much like every other day, was the moment when Betsy internally proclaimed that she was officially giving up.
Continually impressed with the fact that Gabby is a genetics major and her initials are GMO.
It makes me warm fuzzy in my tummy to see Ted favorite my tweets because of how much he dislikes twitter and doesn't use it. OuO #awwww
Remember that time the guy sitting next to me said that the quiz we took "raped him"? Context: we were in women's studies. #whoabuddy
@nucle0tides proudayou
@nucle0tides how are those TOMS holding up?
@andirazo Oh no it's disgusting for long haired people too.

@BitchmasterEvan lowercase xi. What even.
@herro_its_jon EITHER WAY, I guess my main point was "go iowa for being moderately progressive."
@herro_its_jon I think that it is pretty evenly split. I mean looking at senators, the HoR, and past elections... varies a lot.
@herro_its_jon in the last election at least. I guess we are actually quite half and half.
Speaking of crappy stuff from Kansas, Gabby keeps asking me if I ever bought that purple lipstick and it BREAKS MY HEART because I DID NOT.
The life lesson from all of this is never go further south than Des Moines.
Reading about Kansas just makes me really happy that I live in a blue state (that was also the first in the MW to legalize gay marriage).
This candy heart goes out to all my twitter followers. http://t.co/vasqXuxpnA
The few, the proud, the people I know from high school who have met gabby in person.
Proud of Corbin for not dying when the guy Katie got to help de-loft her bed was none other than Starbuck's very own Benedict Cumberbatch.
@nucle0tides are those lindt truffles? Does this mean you will no longer be taking mine?
@khaleesi_ebooks Yeah, that would work! If we need more I'm sure it won't be hard to find someone else, but I think we'll be fine.
@khaleesi_ebooks Yeah, probably! Would like 4:30 or 7ish work?
Why does my phone think that monologue is spelled monolog?

@Snooooooook why haven't you wished me a happy half birthday yet omg.
@TheHKopesky Brussels Sprouts are my favorite food, no joke. Throw in some olive oil and bacon? Heaven.
@nucle0tides Thomas and I really are more intelligent because we science and internship and take hard classes and no other majors do that.

Gabby is trying to seduce me SOS
You can tell when I'm the most stressed based on the levels in which I am online shopping.
Just went to ASOS to see their current deal is $25 off a $125 purchase, and I just think "I could do that! but... maybe... I shouldn't."
Convince me that I shouldn't buy this lipstick or I'm not going to be able to stop myself.
@nucle0tides oh my god I hate you oh my god oh my god oh my god
@nucle0tides yes:(
Loop-hole: Celebrate @andirazo's birthday as she would... with irresponsible amounts of make-up.
My birthday isn't for another 6 months. MY BIRTHDAY ISN'T FOR ANOTHER SIX MONTHS.
Make-up wish list: MAC Heroine Lipstick, a good contouring powder, and BETTER FACE BRUSHES EEEEEEK.
Found a match of that violet lip color I wanted, and for $8 cheaper. OH GOD PLEASE, I WANT IT SO BAD.
Was about to climb into Gabby's loft but then decided that I didn't want to think about the cooties that are probably multiplying in there.
@andirazo hawt cootoor. NO IT'S FREAKING "hote coTURE"
STOP CALLING THINGS COUTURE WHEN THEY'RE NOT COUTURE.
I see more Gabby hair in my room than my hair on a daily basis. Granted, the results are probably skewed because her hair is easier to see.
Why are there dark brown hairs everywhere in my room? OH WAIT.
@herro_its_jon @Jjjohn0404 why am I being lectured about this and not Little John?
@herro_its_jon @Jjjohn0404 I mean we all know he's just trolling. He's being rude so I'm going to be rude back. It was a joke.
@herro_its_jon @Jjjohn0404 I'm not going to start a fight or something. I'm saying little John doesn't really interact with women that much.

@Snooooooook yeah, August birthdays! *fist pounds*
@Quantum_Tom here, Take my paycheck.
@andirazo but I love it so much at its current length!
Ted and I both agree that I COULD try a pixie cut, but @andirazo  has already set the bar too high.

@nucle0tides Oh my god what happened to your nose I'm so sorry.
Actually, I think the fact that Ted can't come this weekend is good because then I never have to get out of bed, shower, or talk to anybody.
I just cleaned my phone screen with spit. Just a warning to anyone who might be planning on using it...
Is it a good friendship or a bad friendship if it mostly revolves around you constantly apologizing to each other?
I'm meeeeeeeltinggg.
I'm so grateful for how awesome my parents are it's not even funny.
WHY IS NO ONE RESPONDING TO MY TEXTS. I WANT TO KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON. TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON.
I wonder if I feel like crap because I've only eaten 3 protein bars in the last 45 hrs, or if I've eaten so little because I fell like crap.
I might have just created a monster. Never text your mother while you're in a bad mood.

That was a joke, I can't handle anything ever.
Betsy post-midnight can not handle anything.
But there's this flawless origami pleated sweatshirt that's MAROON (my favorite color) and is on CLEARANCE and I LOVE IT.
I need to stop looking at ASOS because not buying all the beautiful tops just makes me hate myself. I HAVE A PROBLEM.

Scratch that. I'll walk to UDCC, but ONLY if I get a package notification.
I'll walk to Howe and that's it.
If I have to walk from Martin to Physics Hall tomorrow morning, I'm pretty sure I'll cry.

Someone tell me one instance in which I was mean to Kyla Rand. ONE.
Let's recall that you didn't tell your own roommate that you were moving until an hour before and you didn't tell your suitemates AT ALL.
My ex-suitemate is spreading rumors &amp; taking stuff out of our room because I FOLDED AND RECYCLED A POSTER THAT I THOUGHT SHE DIDN'T WANT.
Danielle found a pocket knife in her laundry and thought it was a death threat. Turns out it belongs to MY RIDICULOUS BOYFRIEND. #conspiracy

@CaymenJ no I'm being serious! Sorry, I'm sarcastic so often that I know it's really hard to tell on the internet!! hahah...
@CaymenJ wow, thank you! I totally forgot that this was I thing!
@ohhhnataliee I KNOW BUT THEY DIDN'T BELIEVE ME
I even tried convincing Tom &amp; Gabby that Cedar Falls was a fun place to be in hopes that they'd go there and I could stow away in the trunk.
Hey college kids, that's enough for gas AND alcohol! #wow #PREISHEA
I honestly think I'd drop a solid $50 if someone actually drove Ted from Cedar Falls to Ames, so there's that.

Is it wrong to put lipstick on at two in the morning?
It was a beautiful run while it lasted.
I can't believe Henry still isn't gay:(
For starters, if you try to sneak another word after "um" or "uh" in the third round, you have to go through the... SPANK MACHINE.
Playing (the game that is called) naked with sheltered dorm mates is NOTHING compared to playing naked with high school friends.

@nucle0tides I was trying to figure out something I could sew it ONTO.
Take off pajamas. Shower. Put on clean pajamas. Repeat. IT'S THE CIRCLE OF LIFE.
I got some new perfume stuff and it's great because it smells fruity, sweet, and a little bitter, just like me.

@nucle0tides I just miss you ok
John Kirchener is frighteningly good at dance dance revolution.
I really want to road trip to Gardner, Kansas is that weird gabby needs friends.
Day 13: I haven't seen gabby since last year. HAHAHAOHOHO sadness
@tessacone I mean I wasn't too worried about it I was just like WELL THAT WILL BE A LITTLE CONFUSING
RT @tshone3: I'm a party animal! (Animals never go to parties, and if they did, they wouldn't be able to behave socially like a normal huma‚Ä¶
I just accidentally snap chatted @tessacone  something that wasn't supposed to go to her. Eh.
Jon and Andi were Tom and Gabby before Tom and Gabby were Tom and Gabby. #IdStalkThat
Day 12: the worst part of 2013 was that time I didn't know who Gabby Ortman was yet.

I guess I should shower at least one more time before 2014, shouldn't I.
@nucle0tides I never liked you. *whispers too close for comfort* I LOVED YOU
@nucle0tides I was bored! Also you reblog nice things. Go you.
Day 11 sans Gabby: I found her tumblr.
RT @arzE: 2014 trend forecast: WEEPING &amp; GNASHING OF TEETH
@nucle0tides only five? I know you can do better than that.
@nucle0tides then I suggest self-loathing.
@nucle0tides cookies
Well, well, well, look who's back on tumblr. (It's me)
@nucle0tides I suggest ice cream
@nucle0tides you're welcome no problem my pleasure
@nucle0tides yes
Excuse me, but I have to ask... Are you a Satan worshiper? I just noticed that you were watching a Cedar Rapids news station OTHER THAN kcrg
Boy Oh boy do I ever love pity.
Whatever you're into, @averypmeyer http://t.co/czTj9KGfj8
Stop tweeting about football. Start tweeting about science. Start talking about haute couture. Start tweeting about something I care about.
Part off me is like "I need to own one nice pair of heels," but then another part of me is like "no one invites you to anything heel-worthy"
I'd text Ted to hang out, but that would mean getting out of this chair and THAT would mean getting out from under this electric blanket.
I just want everything I've ordered to ARRIVE. (I'm looking at you patent leather Doc Martens)
I changed my picture today for the first time since I got my twitter. As much as I love the Betsy Spewing Glitter pic, it was 4 years old.
@nucle0tides lol why lol how will people know that whatever I'm typing isn't serous lol how will I end my sentences lol
I'm a lesbian with a huge crush on Ellen Degeneres, but I settle for Ted. HAHAHAHAHAHAH OH MY GOD GET IT?
@Heyhler that'd be great.
@Heyhler I've been trying really hard to get her to file a restraining order.
Day 9 sans Gabby: grandpa might think I'm a real life lesbian. I'm not. EXCEPT FOR WITH GABBY. No, okay, just kidding.
... zing?
You're welcome, parents. I already did the speech for you.
"Betsy, you need to develop better study habits if you want to stay in honors."
"You can do better than this because you are smart, honey."
Congrats to everyone for having final semester grades that they feel they need to brag about.
Day 8 sans Gabby: family members who read my twitter are mocking me, but THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND MY LOVE.
@nucle0tides I can also recommend colors &gt;:)
@nucle0tides also it's not make up, but Haus of Gloi is awesome.
@nucle0tides shiro, fyrinnae, and my pretty zombie are my favorites. /r/indiemakeupandmore is also a good resource!
@nucle0tides maybe that's how Thomas feels when I'm around. JUST KIDDING I'M FLAWLESS.
@Quantum_Tom I Thomas I'm talking 2 u.
@Quantum_Tom me Thomas, I luv u.

@SamFathallah you nod so hard that you break your neck and die. At your funeral your loved ones nod in agreement that you were too young.
@SamFathallah you shrug so hard that your shoulders dislocate &amp; your arms switch sides. You feel indifferent about the situation and shrug.
In case anyone was worried, I was just as sassy at the age of 5 as I am 13 years later.
You roll your eyes so hard that they go into the back of your head and you see your brain and it is rolling its eyes at you.
GUESS WHICH GRANDPARENT STILL HAS SLEEP APNEA. It's you, grandma.
@MLosen It may also intrigue you that 3:00 AM is no different.
@Heyhler Merry Brownmas, Ehler.
@Heyhler Merry Christmas, Ehler.  Can you differentiate between red and green? Legitimate question.
Wait, remember when ANY morning was something to look forward to? HAHAHAHAHAHAH *cries*
Remember when Christmas morning was really exciting and something to look forward to?
This year for Christmas we all learned that empty tampon boxes are the perfect gift delivering containers.
Remember when you were young &amp; would fall asleep somewhere so your parents would carry you up to your room &amp; tuck you in? I want that back.
@nucle0tides Oh right. Well STILL.
@MLosen Paradise.
@nucle0tides u kitten me? I haven't gotten anything indie related and it made up 90% of my wishlist :,(
@nucle0tides order indie cosmetics
"Hey Betsy do you want to be in PARADISE?" *gets fleece blanket thrown on her*
Day 5 sans Gabby: all I want 4 xmas is u
For those wondering, this year's (final revision) Losen Christmas Card was written and designed in its entirety by me. Sorry world.
My dad was just gargling to the tune of Smells Like Teen Spirit. I kinda want to do it too now. Looks like he's stupid and contagious.
You can call me the Sudoku Queen. (Please don't actually call me that)
@Quantum_Tom new phone background &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 no I'm kidding I'd scream every time I turned on my phone.

@nucle0tides is just a fancy title for "I took a lot of science, math, and/or technology classes" that allows you to make $$$$$$$
Refer to previous tweet of you're wondering just how happy I am it's winter break and I don't have to walk anywhere.
RT @ISUWeatherBot: Currently at ISU, it is fair and it is 2F. Tomorrow it will be sunny with a high of 1F and a low of -14F.
Day three sans gabby: I was so torn up about not being near her that I forgot to tweet about it. Hopefully tomorrow will be better.
Are Thomas and Gabby being passive aggressive with each other or other people on twitter? Either way it's pretty entertaining.
Every time I go to a public place in Cedar Rapids I think "what if I see Michael Snook here."
@Quantum_Tom NOW I'M BUSY, THOMAS.
@Quantum_Tom I tuned in for surgeon simulator. Where did it go.
I hope there's a snow day tomorrow!!!! #ISDCWT
Day 2 sans gabby: haven't eaten in 22 hours. I can't eat with the thought of her not here with me.
@nucle0tides I mean there are better books by John Green himself! Tfios was just like... sad and cute... And that's it.
I just saw my family's Christmas card and now I want to crawl into a hole until January.
Day one sans gabby: Weird tingling in left foot. Lack of cats.
Still don't know how I feel about this whole 3 weeks away from Ames thing.
@nucle0tides I just put them in the dryer go me.
@nucle0tides I can't I have to paaaaack and then Danielle has to paaaaack
@nucle0tides and to think that at one point I actually wanted sleep tonight!
@nucle0tides #threesome2012
I mean Thomas was like "you could sleep on our futon tonight," but I'm 99% sure he was talking to Gabby. #packing2013
I. NEED. MY. BEAUTY. SLEEP. *flips hair*
The best part is that I can't sleep on the futon because she wants to use both rooms to pack.
"I'll be waking up at 7 tomorrow to pack so sorry when I turn lights on and start banging around," she says, wide awake and not packing.
@Quantum_Tom Lana...Lana... LANAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

I need to go talk to some food about this.
Go to room to be alone&gt; room mate and boyfriend are in there. Gross.
@nucle0tides no the ice cream part is important.
If I start crying in the hallway, will someone bring me Peanut Butter Panic ice cream?
Where did Ted go? Oh wait that's right he's two hours away whoops.
I just want to nap, but I have to finish my English portfolio.

Wear dark red lipstick to all of your finals so that even if you fail the exam, YOU'LL STILL BE THE QUEEN.
@nucle0tides the answer is yes. I was sleeping.
I love that Sarah only extends her bed time for Christmas movies.
Someone please help me get the sheets back onto my bed.
I want to watch a movie. Who wants to watch a movie with me? You can pick, as long as is from my ~elite collection of films~ ...or not, idc.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaand I've reached my limit for awful today.
Gabby is skyping her dad and talking about poop and farts and now I miss my dad and talking about poop and farts.
My phone is dead I can't even play puzzle games anymore SOS remember me when I'm gone
Can you tell I'm in a bad mood tonight? I guess it's okay because Gabby's in a somewhat bad mood too and we can be bitter together &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
Everyone I interact with here has their boyfriend near them and I just sit on my phone playing puzzles and wishing it were next fall already
Eating pretzels, thinking about murder, etc.
@nucle0tides I've created a monster *cackles*
I put on dark lipstick and all of the sudden I'm rocking the wicked witch of the west side of campus look.
@khaleesi_ebooks this is for you: http://t.co/LPG4Ztjcs5
@nucle0tides that wasn't meant to be mad or whatever. Just an acknowledgment of my inability to sleep.
Gabby was in my room for 7 hours working on her paper, which coincidentally is way longer than any amount of sleep I'll be getting tonight.
@nucle0tides HAHAHAHAHAHAH only after I wake up tomorrow morning.
@susanjl Converse size 4 or 5 please, thanks.
@khaleesi_ebooks excuuuuuuuuse you. http://t.co/E7FhQXNcGy

@nucle0tides how do you know I'm not
@nucle0tides no u
I was going to go to sleep but then I started looking at haute couture runway shows and now I definitely won't be getting sleep.
Stop hanging out in the den, Gabby and I clearly have the entire room reserved because we are above the law.
More Columbia base layer leggings have moved to the top of my Christmas list.
@nucle0tides go to sleep
Idk, it's 2 am and I'm emotional and mentally unstable.
All I want for Christmas from Ted is a card and on the inside it says "surprise I'm transferring this semester."
Where did my button-up chambray shirt go :( :( :(
Why does my phone keep giving me Google plus notifications? Are people doing that now?
Today I ordered Christmas gifts for my dad and brother. Go meeeeeeeee.
Everyone is already deciding where they're going to live next year and I'm like yeah guys I totally have my life planned out that far too.
@nucle0tides do I need to come rescue you? Gabby it's scary outside come back.
Ted and Tom are playing Battlefield 4 together now which is cute, but now Gabby and I won't be able to talk to them like ever again.
@Quantum_Tom Gabby and I are gonna need a livestream of you and Ted playing Battlefield 4
My 3000th tweet goes out to @Snooooooook for giving me popcorn and @Quantum_Tom and @nucle0tides for not filing a restraining order yet.
So far I have gifts for Ted and my mom. I need my dad, brother, and two uncles. Buh.
What the pants am I supposed to get everyone for Christmas.
Where did everyone go
@nucle0tides channeling your inner Betsy, I see.
@nucle0tides did you just send me a picture of your boobs.
Michael asked me if I knew where Gabby was, but why would I it's not like I implanted a chip in her &amp; Tom so I could always find them. What.
Gabby disappeared
I went to see Thor and didn't realize until the end that the bad guy (Malekith) was Christopher Eccelston. Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat.
Every time I accidentally mistype my name I yell "MY NAME'S...NOT...RIIIIIIICK!" in my head. Like in that episode of spongebob.
Well somebody please make pfefferneusse with me this weekend? I only have two left. It's a crisis.
I've had to hold myself back from tweeting so many clever but bitter things tonight.
@YesSarahWaste I'm truly honored that they are gracing me with their loudness while I complete my loads of homework.
@YesSarahWaste her boyfriend's apartment!
@YesSarahWaste but we would have no where else to go. Also Ted is 20x better than all other boyfriends, duh.
Why are you hanging out with your boyfriend HERE when you could hang out with your boyfriend ANYWHERE ELSE.
More pfefferneusse, please.
You know you have a great winter coat when it's so cold you can't feel your legs, but the top half of your body is sweating.
@SamFathallah you went to the aerospace building of ISU wOoOoOoOoOw
There are like... 10 too many frat boys in this Panda Express.
I've gotta find Ted Payne so we can do a jumping high-five about all of this.
BOTH ERIN AND TED ARE TRANSFERRING TO IOWA STATE NEXT YEAR AAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH
I saw @SamFathallah it was magical he basically has to go to Iowa State now
I got all the way up in my loft before realizing I forgot to take out my contacts. NOOOOOOOOOO
Do you ever want to take a picture of your phone and then realize your phone is your main picture-taking-and-sharing device?
I'm like really good at over staying my welcome. Probably because I don't like getting up and I'm mildly bad at reading social cues.
Ted has been on twitter like TWICE this week, which is a record of I've ever seen one.
@nucle0tides RAD
@nucle0tides are you saying I can come and look at weird clothes in your bungee chair?
I prop my dorm door open so it looks like I'm open to friendship... I mean I am, but it doesn't work.
I still feel bad about spoiling the end of downton abbey for Mr. Willett
Turns out I can't wear thick scarves any more unless I want my hair to look like a 50's housewife's.

"We made a new tinted moisturizer. What should we call it?" "I don't know, just pick a letter, double it, and add cream to the end"
Also #ugh autocorrected itself to #blessed, so thanks @susanjl.
My roommate won't stop gushing about how cute and adorable her new boyfriend is and I'm just like "uh excuse me have you seen mine?" #ugh
I sure did miss climbing in and out of my loft bed!
@nucle0tides do it. Doooooooooo itttttttttt.
I thought I saw a tumble weed blow across the floor of my dorm, but turns out it was just hair.
OMG I can't believe the new LMhoes hasn't tweeted about me yet wow
There's nothing quite like Christmas bitterness to cancel out all the Christmas joy and Christmas cheer.
@MissMerrieBear OH MY GOD THAT'S SPECTACULAR.
I don't feel like putting on make up today, but my family is decorating the Christmas tree, so basically pictures WILL be taken.
@nucle0tides why can't I retweet thaaaaaaaat
I went to raygun and all I got was stuff with cats on it.
So far everything I've purchased has been for Ted. So basically I'm great, right?
We've been at this mall for 3 freaking hours. I don't think it will be a problem for us to shop until Jordan Creek opens at 5am.

@nucle0tides DAY 1 SANS GABBY. TRIED TO FILL HOLE IN HEART WITH SCARVES AND CAT PICTURES. ATTEMPT WAS UNSUCCESSFUL.
After living in Martin, every other sink I encounter seems to have weirdly low water pressure.
@nucle0tides that's what my phone always auto corrects your name to.
@YesSarahWaste I went to my last 2.
Class was NOT worth going to today.
I probably just need to photoshop myself into more of their pictures.
It's weird though because I'm trying really hard to creep them out but they still talk to me. Am I not trying hard enough?
Well today has been sufficiently weird. In other news, I finally achieved my college goal of being Tom and Gabby's third wheel.

@vigfresh @Maggeggie IN AEROSPACE ENGINEERING YOU DO.
@vigfresh when you see a girl in yoga pants, do you assume she is smart? Now compare her to a girl dressed in jeans w/ no make up.
@vigfresh I didn't say that. I said there's a gap. Do you have to dress a certain way so that the men will respect you in STEM classes?
RT @Jjjohn0404: Who wants to ice skate down union drive with me?
@vigfresh oppress me? Hell no. I'm above you. I'm saying that when applied to both genders there's a gap in WHY they're treated that way.
@vigfresh sorry let me finish that tweet "... Because of their sexism"
Men are holding back advancements in engineering.
@Maggeggie @vigfresh shut up maggie, how DARE you talk back to a powerful man like Vig!
@vigfresh it'd be wrong of the way he dressed was sexualized. Men are rarely treated as objects.
