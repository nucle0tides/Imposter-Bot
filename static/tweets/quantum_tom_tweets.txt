#ProjectAlmanac sucks
This guy is smart enough to get into MIT but not smart enough to time travel safely? #ProjectAlmanac
Ah so when the main character is wearing glasses that means he's being rational. When he takes them off he's impulsive and ruins TIME.
Pro: We save the people who died on this plane crash.
Cons: We forget about lollapalooza.
Well the choice is obvious, don't save the people

There's going to be a dark turn in this movie. Maybe after a time jump they all fuse together into some gross being?
They go to Lola, as underage highschoolers. What a waste of time for them.
BUT THEY GOT PLENTY OF IT, DON'T THEY??
